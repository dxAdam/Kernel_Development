# User Level Threads
As far as we know, everything required for this project works as expected. 
Running threads with valgrind reveals no memory leaks. We now present an 
overview of some design decisions we made for this project. The following are the
files we changed: 
 - pet\_thread.c
 - pet\_thread\_hw.S

## Test cases
### test.c
Two threads are created to print something 10 times. At each iteration, the threads yield to each other. 

### test\_join.c 
Two threads are created to print something 10 times. After 5 iterations, thread 1 joins to thread 2. 

### test\_nested\_join.c
Three threads are created to print something 10 times. Thread 1 joins to thread 2, which joins to thread 3. 
Each thread returns its thread number to the one that joined to it. 

### test\_many.c
The ultimate test of our nesting capabilities... Prints a sick pattern created by nesting joins for 20 threads + some printf magic. 
Also tests the same pattern using yields. 

## Overview of implementation

### High level thread management
We employ a simple round robin to schedule threads. When a thread becomes ready (after creation, for example), it is placed at the
tail of ready\_list. pet\_thread\_schedule() then takes an item from the head of ready\_list and calls \_\_thread\_invoker() on it. 
\_\_thread\_invoker() is in charge of moving threads from state to state. It manages three different storage locations: "ready\_list",
"blocked\_list", and the "running" pointer. \_\_thread\_invoker() takes the currently running thread, reads its state to determine which list
to add it to, and puts the target thread in "running" and changes its state to PET\_THREAD\_RUNNING. 

### Joining threads
Each thread struct has a list\_head (waiting\_for\_me\_list) dedicated to keeping a list of threads that are blocked waiting for it to exit. 
When a thread calls pet\_thread\_join(), it adds itself to the waiting\_for\_me\_list of the joined-to thread. When the joined-to thread 
eventually exits, it invariably checks its waiting\_for\_me\_list to unblock (and place in ready\_list) all threads in it. 

### Initial thread context
We write to the top of each fresh stack an initial context with 16 64-bit values. When this fresh stack is invoked for the first time via 
\_\_switch\_to\_stack(), this function will pop 14 of these values to their appropriate registers. We seed the stack so that the argument to the 
thread function so that it gets popped to %rdi, and the pointer to the top of the stack gets popped to $rbp. We also place the pointer to the 
thread function such that when \_\_switch\_to\_stack() returns, this value gets popped into %rip, thus jumping to the thread function code. Lastly, we
seed the stack with a pointer to a custom made assembly function: \_\_capture\_return() (explained below)

### Returning values from joined-to threads
We implemented a nifty scheme to capture return values. A thread has two ways of exiting (both can return a value):
 
 - Placing return value into %rax and calling the "retq" x86 instruction. This jumps to \_\_capture\_return() (as explained above). By calling "return" in the thread function the compiler will first copy the return value to %rax (if a 64 bit value), then it will change stack pointer to point to the value of %rbp, which will put the rsp right above the stack entry containing \_\_capture\_return. Lastly, the compiler inserts a "retq" instruction which will pop \_\_capture\_return into %rip, thus jumping to it. Inside \_\_capture\_pointer, we immediately move the contents of %rax to %rdi (the argument to the next function) and call \_\_quarantine(), which will eventually copy the argument 
to the threads that need it. By writing \_\_capture\_return in assembly, we prevent the compiler from changing (if it wished) %rax before we could get 
to it, since the compiler has that right (%rax is a caller saver register). 

 - Calling pet\_thread\_exit() with the return value as the argument. Inside pet\_thread\_exit(), \_\_quarantine() is called with the ret\_val as the argument, and 
the behavior is the same as the first method.
